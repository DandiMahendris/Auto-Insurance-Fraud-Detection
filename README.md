Frauds are known to be dynamic and have no patterns, hence they are not easy to identify. Amount claimed by fraudulent is significantly huge that may lead to serious loss of money. Such frauds occurred in all areas of insurance claim with high severity including auto sectors that widely claimed by fake accident claim. 

The project applying multiple ML techniques to label and classify fraud claim. Before applying any ML model, we use exploratory data analysis to find how the categoric and numeric features relationship toward target (fraud classification), as well as **feature selection** are used such as ***Chi-squared test*, *Shapiro-Wilk*, *Probability Plot, Welch's Test, Person Correlation, Lasso* Method, *XGBoost* feature importance** and ***Random Forest* feature importance**.

In preprocessing technique, dataset encountered with unpleasant task of high **imbalanced data** of fraud and non-fraud case. Hence, Oversampling and SMOTENC are applied toward dataset, and we will have 3 type of configuration data such as **Non-Balanced, *Oversampling*** and ***SMOTENC***.

The datasets using Auto Insurance Industry and will approached the ***accuracy*, *precision*, *recall*** on ***confusion* *matrix*** and also the ***Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)*** as the evaluation metrics that would be used.

<!-- Business Objective -->
## Business Objective
This research goal is to build binary classifier model which are able to predict fraud transactions. We present our conclusions based on an empirical study comparing different ML models and classification metrics such **Recall** and **AUC Score**.

<!-- Business Metrics -->
## Business Metrics

**Precision** and **recall** should be chosen as the one of the evaluation metrics in classification models.

**`Precision`** is the rate of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. **`Recall`** is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.
A high recall indicates the model is able to classify relevant (positive) results without mislabeling them as irrelevant (negative). On the other hand, high precision indicates the model is able to returned positives predicted values is correctly positives with low irrelevant results (incorrectly positives).

Recall score with low False Negative and high False Positive Rate in AUC score should be parameter to select best model.

  width=400 height=350>
</p>

**AUC Score** is also another consideration to choose the best model. <br/>
**`ROC`** is an evaluation metric for binary classification problems and a probability curve that plots the **TPR** againts **FPR** at various threshold values. <br/>
An excellent model has AUC near to the 1 which means it has a good measure of separability. A poor model has an AUC near 0 which means it has the worst measure of separability

## Related Works
Zareapoor and Shamsolmoali (2015) applied different type of Machine Learning technique namely Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, SVM, and Bagging Ensemble Classifier toward Fraud Detection. They stated most of the time real world fraud data is highly unbalanced since the fraudulent transactions only 2% out of 100%. Another major challenges which frequently reported in many research is about the dynamic patterns of fraud transactions. The methodology they using split the dataset into 4 different sets containing 20% fraud, 15% fraud, 10% fraud, and 3% fraud. They used True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) as the evaluation metrics in these cases since the accuracy of error rate was not the best one to handle imbalanced datasets. The final results is KNN models had much better false alarm rate and fraud catching compare to the others.

</p>

On this stage after data was prepared by checking data shape and data ranges, we split into train data (70%), validation data (15%), and test data (15%) using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` with `stratify=y` cause we want distribute the imbalanced data on same proportion of each dataset.

```python
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state= 42, stratify= y)

x_valid, x_test, y_valid, y_test = train_test_split(x_test, y_test, test_size = 0.5, random_state= 42, stratify= y_test)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Since we are using classification model with labeled data, we want to check the relation between categorical features or numerical features toward the label features.

#### 1. Histogram
--------------------------

What we look out for:
- Potential <b>outliers</b>
- <b>Numeric features that should be categorical (indicator)</b> features. For example, if there are only two possible values like 0 and 1.
- Boundaries that do not make sense, such as <b>percentage value more than 100</b>.

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-3.png" width=80%/>
</p>

Here we provide 4 histogram of numerical features separated by non-fraud (left) and fraud case (right).
- <b>`insured_zip`</b> are prone into two group of <b><500.000</b> and <b>>600.000</b>
- <b>`capital_gains`</b> is highly <b>left-skewed</b> distributed since it has much zero values (0) 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 2. Kernel Density Plot
-----------------------

KDE plot using `klib.dist_plot` to give better distribution comprehension of numeric features, given <b>mean, median, and standard deviation</b>

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-4.png" width=80%/>
</p>

There are several features in the dataset that exhibit a **`bimodal distribution`**, meaning they have two distinct peaks or modes. These features are strongly **correlated with the amount of money**. Consequently, the **occurrence of a value of 0 in these features creates the bimodal distribution**. The correlation with the amount of money suggests that these features play a significant role in determining the monetary values observed in the dataset.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 3. Boxplot of Numerical Features
---------------------

Here, we will separate the data by the target feature and observe how the numeric features are distributed among those which **fraud (target = 1)** and those which **non-fraud (target = 0)**.

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-5.png" width=80%/>
</p>

We can see that **`month_as_customers, age, insured_zip, capital_gains, capital_loss, incident_hours_of_the_day`** <br>
are almost **equally distributed** among those which non-fraud (target 0) and those which fraud (target 1). <br>
This means that training_hours **might not be a good predictor** for the target. 

However, we see that when it comes to **`policy_annual_premium, total_claim_amount, injury_claim, property_claim, vehicle_claim`**,<br> 
a bigger proportion of those who stayed are tending towards more years of experience and these could be **good predictors**.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 4. Barplot
--------------------

We will create count plots of the data using **Seaborn‚Äôs `catplot()`** function and provide **`kind=count`** as a parameter

Notice the parameter **`sharey=False`** in catplot which disassociates the y-scales for each target class so that we can **better view and compare the relationships**.

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-6.png" width=80%/>
</p>

These features show a **significant relationship between target (fraud_reported)**. <br>
Visibly, they **exhibit distinct patterns that are different from each other**. These patterns in the features are strongly associated with the occurrence of fraud, making them crucial indicators for predicting fraudulent activities.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 5. Heatmap Pearson Correlation
---------------

What to look out for:
- Strong relationship between numeric features, drop these features to reduce **redundance (collinearity)** in data.
- **Collinearity** is the state where two variables are highly correlated and contain similar information about the **variance within a given dataset.**

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-7.png" width=80%/>
</p>

To reduce multicollinerity we can drop either **`total_claim_amount`** from the data, since **`total_claim_amount = injury_claim + property_claim + vehicle_claim`**

or the other three **(`injury_claim, property_claim, vehicle_claim`)**

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Feature Selection

#### 1. Chi-Squared Test (Category toward Label)
---------------

**Null Hypothesis**: The two categorical variables have no relationship (independent) <br>
**Alternate Hypothesis**: There is a relationship between two categorical variables (dependannt)


> <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> : (Feature not important)<br> 
> <b>H<sub>1</sub></b> : (Feature important)

Null Hypothesis is trying to tell the probability of observing data at least as extreme as the ones we've observed is assuming the <b>all categories in features did in reality have the same frequency of fraud.</b>

```python
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

X_cat = train_set[list_cat_col].loc[:, ~train_set[list_cat_col].columns.isin(['fraud_reported'])]
y_cat = train_set['fraud_reported']

alpha = 0.05
p_values_ = dict()

for col in X_cat.columns:

    chi2_data = pd.crosstab(X_cat[col], y_cat)

    chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(chi2_data)

    p_values_.setdefault('column', []).append(col)
    p_values_.setdefault('p_values', []).append(p)
    p_values_.setdefault('chi2', []).append(chi2)

    if p < alpha:
        p_values_.setdefault('result', []).append('Reject Ho')        

    else:
        p_values_.setdefault('result', []).append('Failed to Reject Ho') 

chi2_data = pd.DataFrame(p_values_).set_index('column')
chi2_data
```

<p align=left>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-8.png" width=40%/>
</p>

Hence we got the features of `insured_hobbies`, `incident_type`, `collision_type`, `incident_severity`, `authorities_contacted`, `incident_state`, `property_damage` which are Failed to Reject H<sub>0</sub>.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 2. Welch's Test (Numeric toward Label)
----------

Before we performed Welch's Test or Two-Way Test, it approriate to check the parametric assumption such as normality using **`Shapiro-Wilk Test`** and **`Probability Q-Q Plot`** and Equal Variance using **`Levene Test`**.

        Equal Variance would perform Independence T-Test.
        Non-Equal Variance would perform Welch's Test.

-------------------------
        H0 : There's no difference mean between var1 and var2,
        H1 : There's difference mean between var1 and var2,
>**H‚ÇÄ : Œº‚ÇÅ = Œº‚ÇÇ** <br>

>**H‚ÇÅ : Œº‚ÇÅ ‚â† Œº‚ÇÇ**
<br>

```python
import scipy
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

for i, ax in zip(list_num_col, axes.flatten()):

    lst_0 = train_set[i][train_set['fraud_reported']=='N']
    lst_1 = train_set[i][train_set['fraud_reported']=='Y']

    degree = lst_0.count() + lst_1.count()

    x = np.arange(-10,10,0.1)

    t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(lst_0, lst_1, equal_var=False)
    t_crit = scipy.stats.t.ppf(alpha/2, degree)
```

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-9.png" width=60%/>
</p>

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-10.png" width=30%/>
</p>

**Non-Equal variance** group show **Reject H0**, then these vairables is statistically significant

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 3. Heatmap Pearson Correlation
----------

What to look out for:
- Strong relationship between numeric features, drop these features to reduce **redundance (collinearity)** in data.
- **Collinearity** is the state where two variables are highly correlated and contain similar information about the **variance within a given dataset.**

As shown on EDA section above, to reduce multicollinerity we can drop either **`total_claim_amount`** from the data, since **`total_claim_amount = injury_claim + property_claim + vehicle_claim`**

or the other three **(`injury_claim, property_claim, vehicle_claim`)**

On univariate Analysis we conclude that the important features left are `insured_hobbies`, `incident_type`, `collision_type`, `incident_severity`, `authorities_contacted`, `incident_state`, `property_damage` which are Failed to Reject H<sub>0</sub> on Chi-squared Test, `total_claim_amount`, `injury_claim`, `property_claim`, `vehicle_claim` from Welch's Test and reduce the feature on numeric features into `total_claim_amount` only based on Pearson Correlation that mentioned above.

#### 4. Lasso Method
-------

```python
lasso_cv = LassoCV()

# Fit into train_set after StandardScaler
lasso_cv.fit(
    train_scaled.drop(columns='fraud_reported', axis=1),
    train_scaled['fraud_reported']
)

coef = pd.Series(lasso_cv.coef_, index = train_set[train_scaled.drop(columns='fraud_reported', axis=1).columns.to_list()].columns)

imp_coef = coef.sort_values(ascending=False)

import matplotlib

matplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8.0, 7.0)
imp_coef.plot(kind='barh')
plt.title('Feature Importance using Lasso Model')
```

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-11.png" width=70%/>
</p>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 5. XGBoost Method
-------

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

xgb = XGBClassifier()

xgb.fit(
    train_scaled.drop(columns='fraud_reported', axis=1),
    train_scaled['fraud_reported']
)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6))

feat_imp = pd.Series(

    xgb.feature_importances_, 
    train_scaled.drop(columns='fraud_reported', axis=1).columns.to_list()

).sort_values(ascending=True)

feat_imp.plot(kind='barh', title='Feature Importances')

plt.ylabel('Feature Importance Score')
plt.show()
```

<p align=center>
<img src="pict/pics_readme/image-12.png" width=70%/>
</p>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 6. Random Forest
------

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier()

rf.fit(
    train_scaled.drop(columns='fraud_reported',axis=1), 
    train_scaled['fraud_reported']
)

sorted_index = rf.feature_importances_.argsort()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))

fig.suptitle("Random Forest Feature Importances", fontsize=14, fontname='serif', fontweight='bold')
fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.95)

rf_importances = rf.feature_importances_[sorted_index]
rf_feature_names = train_scaled.drop(columns='fraud_reported',axis=1).columns[sorted_index]

```

### Balancing Data

------------

Due to imbalanced issue, the algorithms tend to get biased towards the majority values present and don‚Äôt perform well on minority values. This difference in class frequencies affect the overall predictability of the model since most ML algorithms assume that the data is evenly distributed within classes. In this case, the extensive issue is that the  algorithm will be more biased towards predicting the majority class (non-fraud claim).

In this project, we are compared models performance on unbalanced dataset and balanced dataset with two difference sampling methode namely **RandomOverSampling** and **SMOTE**.

```python
def balancing(x_data, y_data):
    # --- numerical predictor on config--- #
    x_set_num = x_data[config_data['int32_col']]

    # --- categorical predictor on config --- #
    x_set_cat = x_data[config_data['object_predictor']]

    # --- concatenate predictor --- #
    x_train_new = pd.concat([x_set_num, x_set_cat], axis=1)

    # --- SMOTENC --- #
    sm = SMOTENC(random_state=42, categorical_features = list(range(len(x_set_num.columns),32)))
    x_smote, y_smote = sm.fit_resample(x_train_new, y_data)

    # --- Oversampling --- #
    x_over, y_over = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42).fit_resample(x_data, y_data)

    # --- Concate Predictor and Label --- #
    train_set_smote = pd.concat([x_smote, y_smote], axis = 1)
    train_set_over = pd.concat([x_over, y_over], axis = 1)

    return train_set_smote, train_set_over
```

### Handling Outlier Data
------------

Quantile method is given to handle such of outlier data, but its pivot to understand domain knowledge regarding to features which has outlier data since the outlier become sensitive matter, does the outlier should be included on our data or not.

```python
for i, col in enumerate(list_num_col_smote_eda):

    if count >= len(list_num_col_smote_eda):
            break

    q1 = train_set_smote_eda[col].quantile(0.25)
    q3 = train_set_smote_eda[col].quantile(0.75)
    iqr = q3-q1

    train_set_smote_annual = train_set_smote_eda[~((train_set_smote_eda[col] < (q1 - 1.5*iqr)) |
                                            (train_set_smote_eda[col] > (q3 + 1.5*iqr)))].copy()

    sns.boxplot(data=train_set_smote_annual, x=col, ax=axs[i], y='fraud_reported')
```

### Preprocessing

#### 1. Handling Missing Value
---------------------

Data separated into **predictor(X)** and **label(y)**. Numerical and categorical type of data in predictor (X) is splitted and both missing value is handled using `SimpleImputer`

Numeric features missing value is handled with median strategy
```python
SimpleImputer(missing_values = np.nan,
                                strategy = median)
```

And categoric features missing value is handled with constant strategy by filling it with UNKNOWN value.
```python
SimpleImputer(missing_values = np.nan,
                                strategy = 'constant',
                                fill_value = 'UNKNOWN')
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 2. Label Encoding
------------

Machine learning algorithm treat the order of numbers as an *attribute of significance*, it will read a higher ranking of number as more important than the lower ranking. Some distance based machine learning algorithm will harm in such way of ordinal basis while the categorical values doesn't have any relationship.

Hence, categorical feature is separated in two ways, which is nominal categoric and ordinal categoric. Nominal categoric is encoded using **`OneHotEncoder`** that convert each categorical value into new categorical column and assign a binary value of 1 or 0 to those columns. All the values are zero, and the index which contains the value will assign as 1.

```python
def OHE_cat(data, encoder_col = None, encoder = None) -> pd.DataFrame:

    data_ohe = data[nominal]

    if encoder == None:
        # Create Object
        encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown = 'ignore',
                                drop = 'if_binary')
        encoder.fit(data_ohe)
        encoder_col = encoder.get_feature_names_out(data_ohe.columns)
    
    
    # Transform the data
    data_encoded = encoder.transform(data_ohe).toarray()
    data_encoded = pd.DataFrame(data_encoded,
                                index = data_ohe.index,
                                columns = encoder_col)
    
    # Save the object
    util.pickle_dump(encoder, config_data["ohe_path"])

    return data_encoded, encoder_col, encoder
```

**`OrdinalEncoding`** is applied to ordinal value since several data has natural ordered relationship between each other and ML algorithms may be able to understand and harness this relationship.

```python
def OE_cat(data, encoder = None) -> pd.DataFrame:

    data_le = data[ordinal]

    collision_type = ['UNKNOWN', 'Side Collision', 'Rear Collision', 'Front Collision']
    incident_severity = ['Trivial Damage','Minor Damage','Major Damage','Total Loss']
    incident_type = ['Parked Car','Single Vehicle Collision','Multi-vehicle Collision','Vehicle Theft']

    if encoder == None:
        # Create object
        encoder = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[collision_type, incident_type,incident_severity])
        encoder.fit(data_le)

    ## Transform the data
    data_encoded = encoder.transform(data_le)
    data_encoded = pd.DataFrame(data_encoded,
                                index = data_le.index,
                                columns = data_le.columns)
    
    # save the object
    util.pickle_dump(encoder, config_data["le_path"])

    return data_encoded, encoder
```

#### 3. Scaling
----------------

Dataset that neither normally distributed nor having same scale, these terms can affect ML poor performance and leads to unexpected results. Variables that are measured at different scales do not contribute equally to the analysis and might end up creating bias, especially on distance-based machine learning algorithm. Standardization technique using **`StandardScaler`** from sklearn package is used on this project since most features distribution is not gaussian (bell curve) and having varying scales. And the most important part is we simply want to keep some outliers on dataset, which domain knowledge is not understandable.

```python
def scaling_Data(data, scaler=None):

    if scaler == None:

        # Create Fit Scaler
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        scaler.fit(data)

    # Transform data
    data_scaled = scaler.transform(data)

    data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(data_scaled,
                                index = data.index,
                                columns = data.columns)
    
    return data_scaled, scaler
```

This preprocessing step will handled separatedly toward train data, validation data, and test data while the imputer, encoder and scaler will only fitted into train dataset to prevent data leakage on either validation or test dataset.

### Baseline Mean Model
-------------

Baseline mean model is created to understand does the mean of dataset is capable enough to predict the likelihood of whether a transactions is fraud or not. Baseline model in **F1-Score** metrics given is **0.5168 on macro avg** since we are not tend to given weight to minority class.

```python
def Baseline_model():
    dummy_clf = DummyClassifier(strategy='stratified')

    dummy_clf.fit(x_train["nonbalance"], y_train["nonbalance"])

    y_pred = dummy_clf.predict(x_train["nonbalance"])

    report = classification_report(y_true = y_train["nonbalance"],
                                    y_pred = y_pred,
                                    output_dict = True)
    report = pd.DataFrame(report)
    return report

report["macro avg"]["f1-score"]
```

### Create Training Log
-------------

Since out objective is observe multiple Machine Learning models performance toward classification metrics to predict likelihood of fraudulent case on each transaction, we create training log to get important information comparing these multiple ml models on recall, f1-score and training time. Several machine learning model that we are used is mentioned below:

```python
baseline_knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
baseline_dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()
baseline_logreg = LogisticRegression()
baseline_svm = SVC()
baseline_rforest = RandomForestClassifier()
baseline_ada = AdaBoostClassifier()
baseline_grad = GradientBoostingClassifier()
baseline_xgb = XGBClassifier()
baseline_gnb = GaussianNB()
```

### Stratified KFold Cross Validation Score

Stratified k-fold cross-validation is the same as just k-fold cross-validation, but in Stratified k-fold cross-validation, it does stratified sampling instead of random sampling. stratified k-fold is recommended to imbalanced class in classification task, since it splits of samples represent the entire dataset in equal proportion.

```python
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)

for index, model in enumerate(model_object):
    cvs = cross_val_score(estimator=model, X=x_train['nonbalance'], 
                          y=y_train['nonbalance'], 
                          cv=cv, 
                          scoring='f1_weighted')
    mean = np.round(cvs.mean(), 3)
    std = np.round(cvs.std(), 3)
    print(f"cross validation score for the model {model_name[index]} is {np.abs(mean)} +/- {std}.")
```
